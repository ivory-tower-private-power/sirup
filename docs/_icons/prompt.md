*Prompt for Microsoft Co-Pilot*:
> Design a logo for a software tool named "sirup," which specializes in IP rotation. The logo should prominently feature a shield symbol, representing security and protection, filled with binary code composed exclusively of 1s and 0s. The binary code should subtly form the letters "IP" within the shield, highlighting the tool's focus on IP rotation. Use a dark blue or black color for the shield to convey professionalism and strength, and green for the binary code to emphasize the technological and digital nature of the software. The overall design should be modern and sleek, reflecting the secure and technical aspects of the tool.
